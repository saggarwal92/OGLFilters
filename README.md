# OGLFilters

Simple GLFilterViewController allows you to easily add Photo Filters in your application.

### HOW TO ADD 
JUST COPY THE FOLDER NAMED "Files"

### HOW TO USE
Simply extend your current viewcontroller like this
```
@interface YourViewController : GLFilterViewController
@end
```

and override the function returning the image you would like to use to apply filter
>```-(UIImage * )imageToShowInView;```

Depending on your requirements, you may also add your *YourViewController* in a container and set it's custom size


# SAMPLE FILTER INCLUDED IN THE APPLICATION
```
NSDictionary * filterDict = @{
                                    @"name":@"Filter 2",
                                    @"shader":@"noob_filter_shader",
                                    @"files":{
                                        @"Blowout" : @"blowout.png",    //Location in Shader: u_Blowout
                                        @"Overlay" : @"overlay.png",    //Location in Shader: u_Overlay
                                        @"Map" : @"map_2.png",          //Location in Shader: u_Map
                                        }
                                    };
GLFilter * filter = [[GLFilter alloc] initWithDictionary:filterDict];
[YourViewController setCurrentFilter:filter];
```
and you are done.


To Add Custom Filter, follow these steps
1. Simply create your shader file
2. You may be using blowouts, maps, overlay, curveshift, luma, process or any name, simply add those file in resources
3. Create a Dictionary of filter similar to above one

> Format:
```
NSDictionary * filterDict = @{ 
             @"name" : @"Filter Name",   //Following Variable is not used
             //This is the shader of the photo filter where the main filter logic resides
             @"shader" : @"GLFilter Fragment Shader File with Extension glsl",
             //These are the list of images that you may be using in the shader 
             @"files":@{
                     @"key_1" : @"filename.png", //To access the file in shader, it's location will be: u_key_1
                     @"key_2" : @"filename.png", //To access the file in shader, it's location will be: u_key_2
                     //more keys if required
                     }
            }
```
     


Happy Coding!
